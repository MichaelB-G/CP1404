# CP1404 Practical Reflection

Write short but thoughtful answers to each of the following.  
Replace each `...` with your meaningful answer.

## What percentage of the lecture videos have you watched so far?

At the time of writing this I have not watched the last couple videos of the version control content.
But in terms of python coding I believe I am up to date and ready to begin the third module after finishing the version control.

## What time, location and duration have you scheduled to watch lecture videos?
Weekends seem to be the best time for me to consistently practice python coding. I work Monday and Friday, I also have two engineering subjects.
At the moment this works best for me to work on coding during the weekend and try to watch the videos during the later end of the week. But this coming weeks, I am going to try watching 2 videos per night so they are all complete before the weekend. I know this is probably not recommended. But it can be hard, and it usually takes me a little bit of time until the working and studying schedules begin to work together.

## What are you doing well in the subject so far that you will keep doing?
Well in week one I thought I was doing well with practicing python coding but my marks say I only just passed haha. So im not sure, I guess we will see how this next prac is marked.

## What do you need to stop or change in your work for this subject overall so far?
In all honesty it is most probably trying to remove preconditioned habits from previous coding experience, and do my best to stick to the professional syntax and conventions that Lindsay is trying to teach in these videos.

## What are you currently doing poorly for practicals in this subject that you will change?
The answer for this question is quite similar to the previous. Trying to remove preconditioned habits, that do not agree with the standards and follow the professionalism that Lindsay is trying to teach.

## What are you doing really well for practicals in this subject?
I really enjoy functions, I really enjoy learning about how to create a very robust program that looks simple, and easy to understand. It is also exciting to think about how this can be used in ecological science ( Being an ecologist working in research at JCU Cairns ).
