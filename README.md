# CP1404 Practicals

## About This Repository

This repository contains all of my weekly practical work for CP1404 (Programming II) at James Cook University.  
Each prac is in its own folder and demonstrates concepts like input/output, decisions, loops, functions, file handling, classes, and object-oriented programming.

## Clean Code Lessons I've Learned

- Use meaningful variable and function names to make code readable and maintainable.
- Follow the Single Responsibility Principle (SRP) so each function does one clear thing.
- Use version control incrementally, committing small, focused changes with clear messages.
- Avoid “noise” comments — prefer docstrings and inline comments that explain intent.
- Pay close attention to sample outputs and formatting, especially when matching specifications.

## Reflection on Assignment 1 Feedback

I received detailed feedback that helped me understand where my code and practices could improve:

- **Correctness**: Some aspects like input handling and category logic were missing or inconsistent with expectations.
- **Error Checking**: My `mark_movie_watched` function rejected valid inputs — I need to test edge cases more thoroughly.
- **Output Format**: I overlooked small formatting differences from the sample output — even spacing and extra print lines matter.
- **Functions & SRP**: Some of my functions didn’t follow SRP well — too much logic in `main`, not enough modular breakdown.
- **Comments**: While my function docstrings were strong, I need to include more helpful inline/block comments throughout.
- **Version Control**: I only had 3 commits with big chunks of code. I now know to commit smaller changes more often, and to write messages in imperative style (e.g., “Fix loop logic” instead of “fixed loop”).

This prac is an opportunity to apply all of that — especially improving SRP, formatting, and version control practices.
