# Practical 06 Reflection

**How did you go with this practical?**  
This prac went pretty well. It took a bit to wrap my head around classes and object-oriented code, but once I started breaking it into pieces, it made more sense. I liked having structured examples like the Guitar class to follow.

**What did you learn?**  
I learned how to create and use classes to store and manage related data, which is something I’ll definitely use outside uni. Understanding `__str__`, `__init__`, and custom methods like `is_vintage()` helped me see how I can model real-world things like field samples or survey records. Also, managing lists of objects and working with their methods gave me confidence to build small programs that can organise and interpret data more cleanly.

**What could you improve on or do differently next time?**  
I think next time I’d start earlier so I could do a little bit each day. Also, I need to remember to test small chunks before writing too much — it's easier to catch problems that way. Getting used to Git branching earlier in the prac would help too.

**Anything else you’d like to add?**  
The subject content is starting to feel more relevant to my future work. In field ecology, I’ll probably need to collect data from sensors or remote surveys and make sense of it quickly. Knowing how to write structured Python code with classes will make it easier to read from external data sources (like CSV files or simple databases) and process the info. I can already picture writing programs to track species sightings, log water quality, or compare environmental conditions over time.
